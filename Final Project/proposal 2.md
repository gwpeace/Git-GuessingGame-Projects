# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?


“Guess That Capitol”

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will write this program in HTML, CSS, and I will use JS(Javascript). This game will be able to keep track of the current games played, as well as correct / incorrect count for current game. The game will ask a user several questions about some state and last question will be to guess the capital of that state. In that way user could learn more more about some state and also what is the capital of that state. Also will show the state map to help you name the state capital.

OR

I will write this program in Python and I will use framework Flask. This website will allowed any user who register to play the game. The game will ask a user several questions about some state and last question will be to guess the capital of that state. In that way user could learn more more about some state and also what is the capital of that state

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

null

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish correct counting of correct / incorrect state capital guessing.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I can accomplish any user to register/login and save all users and their scores in database, if I use the framework Flask.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Some kind of advanced GUI and data persistence.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?


To complete I will need to learn and enhance skills related to data structure storage (storing data in database), web programming, and login/register user. I will need to practice these further by implementing what I think will be most efficient.
