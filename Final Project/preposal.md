# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO

The ideas I had is to build a guessing game for the final project. The new project ideas that I am submitting is called Guessing Game. It is a game where the user has to guess the capital city of a given state. 

It's going have all the state image showing. Also, it's going to have two score like "high and current Score". The more answer you got by menstion the state capitals is the high score while the less answer you get is the current score. Also, it's going to state "welcome to the guessing game" at the begining of the starting game. It's going to show the map of the each sate and have a circle within the centre of map. In other to help you guess the capitial of the state. It going to have "Press the New Button to begin Playing!" and line where you can answer your question. Also, it's going to have the option where you can choose wether to "guess", "clear", "new" and "reset". The gussing game project is going to have some color like "CSS" on it.  

It's going to said "the state to guess is: North Dakota, enter the state capital below and click guess". It's going to give you another try when you get the answer wrong like "FIRST Hint: The state capital starts with "B" and SECOND Hint: The state capital ends with "k" and THIRD Hint: The second letter in name is "i" in North Dakota". etc. It's going to ask you if you want to reset your game? Showing warning wether you want to lose your high score. 

I hope it meets the criteria for the project

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names? 

TODO

I don't have any who want to work with me. I decided to do the project alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO

I want to know if I can use the CSS, HTML, and JS or To use only python, CSS, and HTML like color to make it look good.
